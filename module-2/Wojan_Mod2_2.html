    <h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>
    <p class="intro"> My name is Emily Wojan, and I am 26 years old. I was born in Houston, Texas, and grew up just outside Houston in Katy, Texas.<span class="sentence"> I have had the privilege of growing up in a very supportive and tight-knit family with my younger sister.</span></p>
    <p>My core family consists of my parents and my younger sister, Grace. My dad has worked in sales my whole life. However, he was in the Navy throughout his early and mid-twenties. My mother is a registered nurse, and when she had my sister and I, she decided to stay home and raise us. My sister recently graduated from college and now works as a first-grade teacher.</p>
    <p>When I was growing up, my parents always encouraged me to explore my interests and pick up hobbies in order to discover what I was passionate about. With their encouragement, I got involved in gymnastics and horseback riding and fostered my love of reading. As I have grown older, I moved away from gymnastics, continued with horseback riding (English riding in particular), and have recently started to get into kayaking.</p>
    <p>When I graduated high school, I initially attended community college before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin. I graduated from the University of Texas with a BachelorBachelors's in Liberal Arts, and I majored in Government with a minor in American History. Currently, I work as an administrative assistant, and I have decided to get my degree in Software Development.</p>
